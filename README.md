# GooglePayPaymentIntegrationAndroid
Google Pay Integration in android app is a very easy task. As we know that Google pay is UPI based payment gateway. Google Pay allows users to send money, receive payments directly into their bank account or make payments for purchases made at stores that accept UPI-based transactions. Google pay send money to other users account without any transaction fees. Setup Google pay API is very easy and having around 20 lines of code only. But I extend this code to make it more flexible and get more control over it.
